        <h1>The life of Joye</h1>
        <div class=text-container>
        <p>Joye says that she feels like she was so lucky to grow up in “perfect harmony”,
             being raised by both parents who were famous, professional, working musicians in 
             New Orleans. They were making a difference with their music! Joye’s mom, Marion Hebert, 
             who played the trumpet, created the first all female band in the early 1930’s, called 
             “Marion Hebert and her all girl orchestra”. Her father played the saxophone and clarinet 
             in Val Barbara’s band on the Steamer President.  This helped Joye develop a true love for 
             music and she started practicing in her living room, mastering the trumpet, guitar, piano, 
             and drums. Joye later played drums professionally in a group called “Sister Beat” and in a 
             rock band called “The Rainbow”. Joye then realized she wanted to make a difference not only 
             with her music but with specific lifestyle changes she experienced herself. As a result of 
             her lifetime of healthy living and education, Joye would love to share with you her innovative 
             and highly successful path to health and well-being.  </p>
